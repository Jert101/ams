2. **Missing `ignore_automatic_updates` Column in `election_settings` Table**
   - Error: Column was defined in the model but not in the database schema
   - Fixed by: Creating and running a migration to add the missing column
   - Migration file: `2025_05_28_234525_add_ignore_automatic_updates_to_election_settings.php`

3. **Data Truncation for `status` Column in `attendances` Table**
   - Error: `SQLSTATE[01000]: Warning: 1265 Data truncated for column 'status' at row 1`
   - Fixed by: Creating a migration to check and modify the enum values for the status column

## Tools Created

1. **Schema Consistency Checker**
   - Created a custom Artisan command: `app:check-schema`
   - Compares model fillable attributes with database columns
   - Helps identify any future schema inconsistencies

2. **Targeted Schema Check Scripts**
   - `check_election_candidate_schema.php`: Verifies ElectionCandidate model schema
   - `check_election_schemas.php`: Verifies ElectionVote, ElectionPosition, and ElectionSetting models

## Verification Process

1. Fixed the immediate error in the member attendances page
2. Created schema checking tools to identify other potential issues
3. Found and fixed all database schema inconsistencies
4. Verified all schema fixes by running the custom checking tools
5. All tables and models are now consistent with each other

## Preventive Measures

- Use the `app:check-schema` command after making any changes to models or migrations
- Make sure to run migrations after creating new models
- Always check for required columns when editing model fillable properties
- Include column validation in controllers to prevent data truncation errors
- When adding ENUM columns, ensure all values are properly defined
