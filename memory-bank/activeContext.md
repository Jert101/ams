# Active Context: AMS (Attendance Monitoring System)

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in the planning and initial setup phase. We're establishing the core architecture and requirements for the Attendance Monitoring System that will replace the existing logbook system for tracking mass attendance.

## Recent Changes
- Updated the Memory Bank documentation to reflect the Attendance Monitoring System requirements
- Defined the core user roles: Admin, Officers, Secretary, and Members
- Outlined the system flow and key features

## Next Steps
1. Implement the core database migrations for users, roles, events, attendances, and QR codes
2. Develop the base models with relationships
3. Create the authentication system with role-based access
4. Implement the QR code generation functionality
5. Develop the attendance recording and approval system
6. Create the notification system for absent members

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Database Structure
Currently finalizing the database schema design with considerations for:
- User role management (Admin, Officers, Secretary, Members)
- Attendance tracking with approval status
- QR code generation and storage
- Consecutive absence tracking

### Authentication and Authorization
Evaluating the best approach for implementing role-based access control:
- Using Spatie Permission package vs. Laravel's built-in Gates and Policies
- Defining granular permissions for different user roles
- Implementing secure login and registration system

### UI/UX Approach
Planning the frontend implementation with Tailwind CSS:
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Role-specific dashboards and interfaces
- QR code display and scanning interfaces
- Attendance reports and visualizations

### Performance Considerations
- Implementing efficient QR code generation and scanning
- Optimizing attendance queries for reporting
- Planning for email notification queuing
- Considering database indexing strategies for common queries

## Current Questions and Challenges
- Selecting the most appropriate QR code library for generation and scanning
- Designing an efficient algorithm for tracking consecutive absences
- Implementing secure QR code validation to prevent spoofing
- Determining the best approach for email notifications using PHPMailer
- Planning for potential offline scanning capabilities
