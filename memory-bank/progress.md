## Current Status
The project is in the planning phase. We've updated the Memory Bank documentation to reflect the requirements for the Attendance Monitoring System that will replace the existing logbook system for tracking mass attendance.

## Known Issues
- No critical issues at this stage as development is just beginning
- Need to finalize database schema design before implementing migrations
- Need to select appropriate QR code libraries for generation and scanning
- Need to determine the best approach for tracking consecutive absences

## Next Milestone
Implement the core database migrations and models with proper relationships to establish the foundation for the attendance monitoring functionality, including user roles, events, and attendance records.
