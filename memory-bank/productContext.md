# Product Context: AMS (Attendance Monitoring System)

## Why This Project Exists
The organization currently uses a manual logbook system to track attendance at mass services, which is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks automated follow-up capabilities. AMS addresses these challenges by providing a digital system for attendance tracking using QR codes and automated notifications.

## Problems It Solves
- **Manual Tracking**: Eliminates paper-based logbooks and manual attendance recording
- **Attendance Verification**: Provides a reliable method to verify member attendance through QR codes
- **Absence Monitoring**: Automatically identifies members with consecutive absences
- **Follow-up Process**: Streamlines the process of notifying members who require counseling
- **Reporting**: Simplifies the generation of attendance reports and analytics
- **Communication**: Improves communication with members through automated notifications

## How It Should Work
The system should provide an intuitive interface where users can:
1. Register as members and receive unique QR codes
2. Have their attendance recorded via QR code scanning by officers
3. View their own attendance history (for members)
4. Monitor attendance patterns and generate reports (for secretary)
5. Receive automated notifications for consecutive absences
6. Manage user accounts and system settings (for admin)

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Minimal clicks to perform common tasks
- **Clarity**: Clear status indicators and intuitive navigation
- **Efficiency**: Quick QR code scanning process for attendance verification
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access
- **Personalization**: Customizable dashboards based on user roles
- **Guidance**: Contextual help and tooltips for new users

## Key User Journeys
1. **Admin**: Managing user accounts, configuring system settings, overseeing the entire system
2. **Officers**: Scanning QR codes to approve member attendance, managing attendance records
3. **Secretary**: Monitoring attendance patterns, generating reports, managing notifications for absent members
4. **Members**: Presenting QR codes for attendance verification, viewing personal attendance history
