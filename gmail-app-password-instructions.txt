If you're using Gmail with 2FA, you need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. Please follow these steps:

1. Go to your Google Account at https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Navigate to Security
3. Under 'Signing in to Google', select 'App passwords' (You must have 2FA enabled to see this option)
4. Select 'Mail' for the app and 'Other' or 'Windows Computer' for the device
5. Click 'Generate'
6. Copy the 16-character app password
7. Update your .env file MAIL_PASSWORD with this password

If you're not using 2FA, you may need to:
1. Allow less secure apps in your Google account security settings
2. Or switch to using an App Password by enabling 2FA

Current Issue with PHP Mailer: 
The Gmail authentication is failing with the error "Username and Password not accepted." 
This typically happens when:
1. The password in your .env file is incorrect
2. You're using a regular password instead of an App Password with 2FA enabled
3. Less secure app access is not enabled (if not using 2FA)

After updating your password, run the test-email.php script again to check if the issue is resolved.
