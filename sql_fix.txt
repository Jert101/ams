-- SQL commands to fix election_candidates table
-- Copy and paste these commands into the SQL tab in PhpMyAdmin

-- 1. First, examine the tables to understand the structure
-- View election candidates
SELECT id, user_id, position_id, status FROM election_candidates;

-- View available users
SELECT id, user_id, name, email FROM users LIMIT 30;

-- 2. Check which candidates have invalid user_ids
-- For each candidate ID from the first query, check if its user_id exists in users.id
-- Replace X with each user_id value you found in the first query
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE id = X;

-- 3. Update the candidates with valid user_ids
-- Use these statements to fix each problematic candidate
-- Replace the values based on what you find in steps 1 and 2

-- Example:
-- UPDATE election_candidates SET user_id = 123 WHERE id = 1;
-- This will set candidate with ID 1 to have user_id 123

-- 4. Alternative approach: Delete problematic candidates
-- Only use this if updating isn't possible
-- DELETE FROM election_candidates WHERE id = X;

-- 5. Verify the fix
SELECT c.id, c.user_id, c.position_id, c.status, u.name 
FROM election_candidates c
LEFT JOIN users u ON c.user_id = u.id;
